## Atomic Write RPCs (Phase 1 — race-condition hardening)

All multi-step financial / inventory writes are wrapped in `SECURITY DEFINER` Postgres functions that use `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` to eliminate TOCTOU races. Edge functions call these via `.rpc(...)` instead of issuing multiple `INSERT`/`UPDATE` statements.

| RPC | Replaces | Guarantees |
|-----|----------|------------|
| `process_redeem_reward(p_member_id, p_reward_id)` | 6-step block in `gamification-redeem-reward` | Locks profile + reward rows; atomic balance check, stock decrement, redemption insert, ledger entry. Returns `OUT_OF_STOCK` / `INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE` error codes. |
| `process_package_sale(p_member_id, p_package_id, p_amount, p_payment_method, p_idempotency_key, p_discount_amount, p_processed_by)` | Multi-step writes in `sell-package` | Atomic insert of `transactions` + `member_billing` + `member_packages` (entitlement) + coupon usage + promotion counters. Idempotency-key dedupe. |
| `process_slip_approval(p_slip_id, p_approved_by)` | Multi-step approval in `approve-slip` | Locks `transfer_slips` row, calls `process_package_sale` internally, updates slip status to `approved` — all in one transaction. Eliminates "paid but no package" orphan state. |

> **Stripe webhook** uses `process_stripe_payment` (added earlier) for the same atomic guarantees.

## Brand Kit Contract

- **Storage:** `settings` table, `section='branding'`, `key='brand_kit'`, `value=BrandKit JSON`
- **Shape:** `src/components/branding/brandDefaults.ts` → `BrandKit`
- **Read:** `useBrandKit()` (TanStack Query, key `queryKeys.settings('branding')`)
- **Write:** `useSaveBrandKit()` (upsert + logActivity `setting_updated` + invalidate)
- **Runtime apply:** `<BrandProvider>` at root → applies CSS vars + `document.title` + favicon
- **Consume in UI:** `useBrand()` returns `{ brand, isLoading }`; prefer `<BrandMark/>` for logo+name
